CS255 DriverPass Project

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was the owner of DriverPass. They requested we make a system that allows customers to purchase and schedule tests for driving classes whether they were online or in person. 

What did you do particularly well? 

I felt that I did a particularly good job regarding the different UML diagrams for the activity, case, sequence, and the class diagrams. I tried to be as clear as I could with each of them so they could be understood. Another section that I felt I had done well would be discussing the technical requirements of the project. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I feel like I could improve the limitations for the project in the business diagram. While I did mention limitations based on avalibility that can plague development cycles I felt that I could also mention limitations based on software and hardware limitations as well.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to stick as close as I could to the users needs for the program. The important thing to understand is that you are making this software for the clients so you need to be able to design it towards their specifications. After all they are the ones purchasing the work we are doing so we need to give them what they require to the best of our ability.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would start simple with the basics of implementing what is neccesary for it to function and then go from there to implement what is required by the user. As for the future I would try to implement more strategies with object orientated design in order to strengthen my design for the software.
